## Primary Category Select Plugin

This Wordpress Plugin allows users to select a Primary Category from a list of many selected categories.  The user can then display a list of posts tagged with Primary Categories on any post or page using a simple shortcode.

## Shortcode

Once you've installed the plugin, simply use the following shortcode to display posts with Primary Categories:
[primary-category name="cat_name"] where "cat-name" is the name of the primary category you would like to view.

## Motivation

Kicking off my GitHub page with a simple Wordpress plugin

## Installation

Install the Zip archive via the Wordpress Plugin screen inside the WP Dashboard, then you will find a new box on all posts/pages/custom post types that lets you select a Primary Category.  You must select standard post categories and update the page before a primary category will be selectable.
